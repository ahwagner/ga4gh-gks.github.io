# GA4GH::GKS Variant Annotation

The Variant Annotation group aims to develop a common data model to represent annotations made on genomic variants, and the evidence and provenance that underlie these annotations. The model will support a wide variety of variant annotations, including causal association to disease/phenotype and interpretations of clinical relevance and actionability, and will support existing clinical lab standards such as the ACMG/AMP variant interpretation guidelines.

## Leads

* Matt Brush
* Javier Lopez
