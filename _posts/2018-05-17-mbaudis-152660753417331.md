<!--  CONTENT  -->

We have now a [__variant-representation-model__repository](https://github.com/ga4gh-gks/variant-representation-model/), as a place to collect legacy, alternative and proposed models for the representation of genomic (+ ?) variants.

<!--more-->

The start here has been made with the addition of some [alternative models](https://github.com/ga4gh-gks/variant-representation-model/tree/master/alternative-models), specifically the ones from the VCF-derived original GA4GH schema and the variant query part of Beacon v0.4.
