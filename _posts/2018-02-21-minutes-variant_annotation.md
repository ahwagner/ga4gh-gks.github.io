### Variant Annotation
##### Chairs: Matt Brush, Javier Lopez
##### Attendees “Name (Affiliation)”: Tim Mercer (Garvan Australia), Pablo Cingolani, Shirley Li (Molecular Match), Chris Bizon (ClinGen), Karen Eilbeck (U of Utah, SO), Robert Freimuth (ClinGen), Larry Babb (ClinGen), Gabe Rudy (Golden Helix), Steve Hart


##### Minutes:

Matt went over scope notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1csUrC4kX6G1V1GIz07btQQ3oL_cdDPJShuauL_uCjEw/edit#heading=h.y4pa1ty7i1hw

Allele Frequency: can be expressed computationally in multiple ways using allele count, number, and frequency.  The population fits in depending upon the scope of the statement that the source is intending to make. Not all statements are simple enough to be expressed in triples, need to figure out ways to represent more nuanced/contextualized statements.

Bob: Is the definition of the variant vs the description out of scope?

Matt: Yes, that fits in Var Rep, but we will make sure the two teams create specs work together. [ACTION: Will add a note at the top of the doc about this]

Matt: Provenance section of metadata would include methods

Larry/Matt: We need to define what is classified as a variant to determine the scope.  Point mutations/haplotypes/full genotypes would be in scope, but representing the annotations/evidence/provenance of exons/genes may be out of scope, but maybe in the future.

Matt went over Driver project engagement notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o8Sz6MGc_pUv8riAEdIOZW56EKEeJcFBXknAQstxA-c/edit?usp=sharing 

Questions: 
- Provide an example of data types you would expect/want to find within the variant annotation model.
- Do you agree with the definition of an annotation bases on the Scope document in Section II?
- Anything you would miss/name in a different way/remove from the scope document Section IV “Variant Annotation Categories”?

Gave example of Clin/Pheno work stream’s Driver Project survey:

Can do something similar or just talk to Driver Projects.  Thinks we should send out the list of questions as something for them to think about and then have targeted interviews.

Driver projects are to implement and test our products, so we need to know that what we deliver supports their needs and the needs of the broader community.

Next week: spend working session developing plan and questions for driver projects.  We want reps from driver projects to help with that.  Add thoughts to DP Engagement Notes doc.
